// The parameters of these waves have been selected to give a similar appearance
// to SEUS-11.0 and SEUS Renewed. In fact, the waves in SEUS PTGI are actually
// just SEUS Renewed waves scaled by a factor of 4 so that they appear to have a
// much higher frequency. However, this makes the tiling artifacts way more
// obvious and IMO, they look worse, but this was likely a necessary tradeoff so
// that the baked water caustics texture used by SEUS PTGI (as opposed to the
// procedural caustics of Renewed) could be kept to a smaller size.
//
//Since we use procedural caustics, that is not a worry for us.
