// This is an improved ray marching implementation inspired by a few ideas from
// Chocapic13's shaders:
//
// - Rapidly accelerate the ray through the scene to quickly find an initial hit
//   and then upon a hit step more slowly through the previous ray interval.
//   This enables aggressive undersampling to avoid spending steps on empty
//   space, which is very common in open-water scenes.
// - Yet, starting off slow permits good local reflections as well
//
// It also has a few of my own improvements on top of those:
//
// - Modify the thickness in a similar fashion to the ray velocity, so that
//   nearby reflections have a slow thickness in meters and far ones have a high
//   thickness. This avoids ugly local results while not making faraway ones too
//   noisy.
// - If we run out of steps while refining, return the last valid hit to avoid
//   returning MISS when we actually have a fairly good hit saved.
//
// Combined, this gives decent-quality reflections using simple, intuitive ray
// marching and a small number of steps, independent of screen resolution.

// The maximum permitted thickness (meters) of a reflection hit.
//
// Thickness allows for inherent imprecision and means that even if we do not
// have an exact perfect match, we can accept a fragment for the reflection.
//
// If this is too low, you will have holes and noise, and if this is too high,
// you will have ugly stretchy reflections.
#define MAX_THICKNESS 8.0

// More steps give extra opportunities for refinements and similar, but also
// come at a potential performance cost for rays that travel very far without
// making a hit or escaping the frustum.
//
// Even if we make a hit, we'll still take a lot of steps to refine
#define RAYMARCH_STEPS 24

// How much to accelerate each step - this allows us to cover long distances
// with simple raymarching without excessive steps or excessive oversampling,
// in fact, it allows fairly aggressive undersampling, and if we overshoot
// (see below) we can retrace at a slower velocity.
#define ACCELERATION_FACTOR 2.0

// How many rounds of recursive refinement to attempt. Each refinement round
// results in us retracing the last traced interval at a slower speed, and may
// take multiple individual steps (see TAPS_PER_REFINEMENT).
//
// With 4 rounds of 4 taps, we're spending up to 20 steps on refinement: 1 step
// each refinement round on hitting and rolling back, and 4 steps on checking
// within that interval.
#define MAX_REFINEMENT_ROUNDS 4

// During each refinement round, we elect to dedicate a certain number of steps
// (TAPS_PER_REFINEMENT) to that individual round, and cover a certain
// percentage of the original step distance (REFINEMENT_DISTANCE) that lead us
// to the intersection. We deliberately do not cover the whole distance, as we
// save the last hit that was at the end of the distance and can use that in the
// worst case.
//
// Given a certain TAPS_PER_REFINEMENT, we can calculate the factor to reduce
// the velocity by using pow(1 / ACCELERATION_FACTOR, TAPS_PER_REFINEMENT),
// which ensures that we will take TAPS_PER_REFINEMENT steps given the
// acceleration factor.
//
// Then, we add one, because we always multiply by ACCELERATION_FACTOR every
// step, including the one directly after initiating this refinement.
//
// Finally, we multiply in the REFINEMENT_DISTANCE at the very end - a value of
// 0.75 means that we cover 75% of the original distance in this refinement
// round.
